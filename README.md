Charm facilitates dynamic analysis of device drivers of mobile systems. This document is a toturial to build Charm on Linux. 

Please refer to our paper for technical details: [USENIX paper](http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ardalan/papers/SeyedTalebi_USENIX_Security18.pdf)

## Prerequisites

It is strongly recommended to backup your system before proceeding.

### Hardware
You need to access to a linux machine with at least 4GB of RAM and 200GB storage.  

### Software
The instruction has been tested on a linux server with ubuntu 16.4. you need to install the build essentials for each project prior to build them. 

## Charm organizaiton

Charm system consists of five main components:
- Phone OS (Lineage OS Android for Bullhead)
- Android emulator 
- Host OS (Ubuntu)
- Syzkaller
- VM OS (AOSP Android for goldfish)

In following section we show how to build these components from source.
**Note: Please use our exact Naming convention for  files and directories.
**
first make a directory for Charm project  and cd to it.
```bash
mkdir Charm && cd Charm
```
then make a directory for each component of Charm.
```bash
mkdir bullhead_lineage
mkdir goldfish_AOSP
mkdir Android_emulator
mkdir Host_Ubuntu
mkdir Syzkaller
```

### build Phone OS

You can skip build process and download a built image from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1W77VjxRwsZLM1T96mqqWJODWpfV54JBX/view) or you may build from the source as following:

#### Download source code
Follow the documention for building Lineage OS (version cm-14.1) for bullhead, from [here](https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/bullhead/build "here").
Note: you need to change these two lines of the documentation:

~~cd ~/android/lineage
repo init -u https://github.com/LineageOS/android.git -b lineage-15.1~~  
Instead use:
```bash
cd Charm/bullhead_lineage
repo init -u https://github.com/LineageOS/android.git -b cm-14.1
```
Note: It might take a few hours to finish. <br />
Note: Repo needs "python" to run. Python is not installed by default in recent distributions of Ubuntu. install python using: `$ sudo apt install python-minimal`
#### Apply changes
Considering you are in `Charm/bullhead_lineage/` directory, In order to apply our changes, perform following steps:
```bash
cd kernel/lge/bullhead
git remote add charm_origin https://github.com/trusslab/charm_bullhead_kernel.git
git fetch charm_origin
git checkout -b Charm charm_origin/Charm
```
go back to `Charm/bullhead_lineage/`, then:
```bash
cd system/core
git remote add charm_origin https://github.com/trusslab/charm_bullhead_core.git
git fetch charm_origin
git checkout -b Charm charm_origin/Charm
```
go back to `Charm/bullhead_lineage/`, then:
```bash
cd frameworks/native
git remote add charm_origin https://github.com/trusslab/charm_bullhead_native.git
git fetch charm_origin
git checkout -b Charm charm_origin/Charm
```
#### Build
To build the system go back to `Charm/bullhead_lineage/`, and run:
```bash
 source ./build/envsetup.sh
 brunch lineage_bullhead-eng
```
Note: You might need to run `export LANG=C` prior bruch command if you are using newer ubuntu distributions for building.

#### Install on the Phone
After build proccess finshes you need to Install the Android on your phone.  Connect your Nexus5x Phone to your system and run:
```bash
adb reboot recovery
```
In recovery menu please select `adb-sideload`. 
Assuming you are in `Charm/bullhead_lineage/`you can reach the OUT directory where all built images are, using:
```bash
cd out/target/product/bullhead 
```
You can find the LineageOS installer package under the name `lineage-14.1-[DATE]-UNOFFICIAL-bullhead.zip` (in which [DATE] is replaced with date of your build). To install the package on your phone:
```bash
adb sideload  lineage-14.1-[DATE]-UNOFFICIAL-bullhead.zip
```
Lineage OS 14-1 for bullhead is compatible with n2g47f vendor image, you might need to update your phone's vendor image if it has a different image. You can find n2g47f images [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZPsOIP6xReLNm8vGz8lE-cXPgFJb1u8T/view?usp=sharing). It is recommanded to update radio and bootloader images to n2g47f as well.

 ### build Android emulator
 #### Download source code
download the source for android emulator from Google. Assume you are in `Charm/` directory:
```bash
cd Android_emulator
repo init -u https://android.googlesource.com/platform/manifest -b emu-2.4-release
repo sync
```
#### Apply changes
then you need to apply Charm changes to the QEMU. 
```bash
cd external/qemu
git remote add charm_origin https://github.com/trusslab/charm_emulator.git 
git fetch charm_origin
git checkout -b Charm charm_origin/Charm
```
#### Build
in order to build the emulator:
```bash
./android/rebuild.sh
```
Note: the expected output should look like this:
```console
Configuring build.

### build Host OS
 #### Download source code
download the operating systme for the host. 
```bash
cd Host_Ubuntu
git clone https://github.com/trusslab/charm_host_kernel.git -b Charm
```
#### Build
   
First you need to install the prerequisites:
```bash
sudo apt install gawk debhelper libudev-dev pciutils-dev libelf-dev autoconf libtool

```
Then build the ubuntu using build script.
```bash
cd charm_host_kernel
source build.sh
```
Note: It might take a few hours to finish.

after instalation finishes go back one directory to `Charm/Host_Ubuntu/ `
to install the built Ubuntu on your system:
```bash
sudo dpkg -i linux-*4.10.0-28.32*.deb
```
#### Update the Grub
You need to ubdate the Grub and reboot your machine and boot the new Ubuntu.

_____________________________

### build VM OS
 #### Download source code

download the operating systme for the Charm's VM. 
```bash
cd goldfish_AOSP
git clone https://github.com/trusslab/charm_emulator_kernel.git -b charm_goldfish_camera
```
#### Build
first you need to install prerequisites.
install device tree compiler using
```bash
sudo apt install device-tree-compiler
```
Then you need to get the gcc compiler for building the android as following:
```bash
cd ~/Charm/goldfish_AOSP
mkdir compiler
cd compiler
git clone https://android.googlesource.com/platform/prebuilts/gcc/linux-x86/x86/x86_64-linux-android-4.9
```
Then to build the kernel
```bash
cd ~/Charm/goldfish_AOSP/charm_emulator_kernel
source build_x86_64.sh
```
Then you need to download the [ramdisk.img](https://drive.google.com/open?id=16Tb9zvMJgMMz5OjmD_TPAkgWke2hUVq4), [system.img](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1i9_xYUouLacay61PV1sfNGoOseCF8DdK/view?usp=sharing), [encryptionkey.img](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NhZAYi2U4L0gvupBg2Oy_-FUB_maWbOc/view?usp=sharing), and the [userdata.img](https://drive.google.com/open?id=19InKHZPvN3zXdLBxldiQ9XUwc9u4dkof) and save them in `~/Charm/goldfish_AOSP/` folder.

### Run Charm emulator
First you need to make an Android Virtual Device(AVD) to run the emulator.
#### Make an AVD
To make an AVD you need to download and install the [latest Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/) first.  
Then open Android Studio, enter 'Cntrl+Shift+a'  to open search menu, then type `AVD manager` and open AVD manager.  
Select Nexus5x in AVD manager.
![AVD1](pictures/AVD1.png)
In the next step you need to check for the Nougat android and an ABI suitable for your machine.
![AVD2](pictures/AVD2.png)
In the next step name your AVD `Nexus_5x_Charm` and set both camera options to `None`.
![AVD3](pictures/AVD3.png)
#### Run Charm emulator using scripts

first you need to download the scripts to run Charm emulator.
```bash
cd ~/Charm/
git clone https://github.com/trusslab/charm.git
```
Then you need to update the scripts using your phone device ID. you can find your phone device ID using:
```bash
adb devices
```
to update the script with your device ID:
```bash
cd ~/Charm/charm/scripts
vim charm_run.sh
```
then edit the DEVICE_ID and run the `charm_run.sh`.
